## A - Cleaning Shifts
### describe

        Farmer John is assigning some of his N (1 <= N <= 25,000) cows to do some cleaning chores around the barn. He always wants to have one cow working on cleaning things up and has divided the day into T shifts (1 <= T <= 1,000,000), the first being shift 1 and the last being shift T.

        Each cow is only available at some interval of times during the day for work on cleaning. Any cow that is selected for cleaning duty will work for the entirety of her interval.

        Your job is to help Farmer John assign some cows to shifts so that (i) every shift has at least one cow assigned to it, and (ii) as few cows as possible are involved in cleaning. If it is not possible to assign a cow to each shift, print -1. 
    Input
        * Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and T

        * Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains the start and end times of the interval during which a cow can work. A cow starts work at the start time and finishes after the end time. 
    Output
        * Line 1: The minimum number of cows Farmer John needs to hire or -1 if it is not possible to assign a cow to each shift. 
    Sample Input

        3 10
        1 7
        3 6
        6 10

    Sample Output

        2

    Hint
        This problem has huge input data,use scanf() instead of cin to read data to avoid time limit exceed.

        INPUT DETAILS:

        There are 3 cows and 10 shifts. Cow #1 can work shifts 1..7, cow #2 can work shifts 3..6, and cow #3 can work shifts 6..10.

        OUTPUT DETAILS:

        By selecting cows #1 and #3, all shifts are covered. There is no way to cover all the shifts using fewer than 2 cows.

大意：农夫有N头牛，需要工作T时间，每头牛的工作时间段是确定的，求最少需要几头，如果不能完成输出-1。

思路：先按照区间大小排序，选择尽量时间区间尽量大的。

## B - Radar Installation
### describe

        Assume the coasting is an infinite straight line. Land is in one side of coasting, sea in the other. Each small island is a point locating in the sea side. And any radar installation, locating on the coasting, can only cover d distance, so an island in the sea can be covered by a radius installation, if the distance between them is at most d.

        We use Cartesian coordinate system, defining the coasting is the x-axis. The sea side is above x-axis, and the land side below. Given the position of each island in the sea, and given the distance of the coverage of the radar installation, your task is to write a program to find the minimal number of radar installations to cover all the islands. Note that the position of an island is represented by its x-y coordinates.

        Figure A Sample Input of Radar Installations


    Input
        The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers n (1<=n<=1000) and d, where n is the number of islands in the sea and d is the distance of coverage of the radar installation. This is followed by n lines each containing two integers representing the coordinate of the position of each island. Then a blank line follows to separate the cases.

        The input is terminated by a line containing pair of zeros
    Output
        For each test case output one line consisting of the test case number followed by the minimal number of radar installations needed. "-1" installation means no solution for that case. 
    Sample Input

        3 2
        1 2
        -3 1
        2 1

        1 2
        0 2

        0 0

    Sample Output

        Case 1: 2
        Case 2: 1
### code
大意：海面上上有n个小岛，在坐标轴x上建立最少的雷达站，覆盖所有的小岛，如果不能全部覆盖，输出-1.

思路：如果小岛的y坐标大于雷达半径d则肯定不能完全覆盖。用勾股定理求出在每个小岛在x轴上能被雷达覆盖的范围，按照范围给小岛排序，遍历小岛，如果相邻的小岛
没有重合部分就+1
